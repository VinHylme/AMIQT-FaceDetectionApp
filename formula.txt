We define a set of images I
for each image in I
Set of landmarks, L, from image
(x, y) ? L,
 i.e. (34, 45) ?  L
We then create patches for each landmark in L
We define a patch, p = [x1, 1 … x32,1
                                          x1,32... x32,32]
where 255 >= x >= 0, Representing grayscale value
Convert patch to 1 dimension, [x11, x12, x13....
Create 1d matrix of patches for a single image
P = [p1, p2...p49]
1024 * 49 pixels in the patches for a single image
A contains patches for all images
A is the trainset matrix.
In order to score an image, we do the following...
Rinse + repeat, then 
f = B^T * A, f is. = a vector size of A (number of trainset images).
Find largest value in vector. Index of max(f)
map index to image name 
use corresponding score of image to return final score
Representing the Red-Green-Blue color value of a pixel

X ? x – x
x ? x/||x||
a = [x1, x2... xn]
repeat x for b
si = bT. ai
